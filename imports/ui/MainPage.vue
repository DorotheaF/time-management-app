                    <h1> Priority List In these past 5 years however, you have also become my friend. The first time you asked me if you could be my best friend, I laughed it off, mainly because you meant it as a joke, but also because it seemed redonkulous at the time. But not only have you made me who I am, but I have shared some of the most meaningful laughs and memories of my life with you. You might not have had the choice to have me for a daughter, but you did have the choice to make your friend, and I am so grateful for that.</h1>

                         We donâ€™t always agree with each other, and that is perhaps why I am then able to value our relationship all the more. You have shown me how much deeper a friendship can go, and how important it is to hold on to those you care about. Linsey, you are considerate and yet strong willed. When you have a want or need, you let nothing get in your way, and yet you know how to reach out to others, and how to listen.
